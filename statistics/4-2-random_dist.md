[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

>> The numbers generated by `random.random` are supposed to be uniform between
>> 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability.

>> Generate 1000 numbers from random.random and plot their PMF and CDF.
>> Is the distribution uniform?

```python
import thinkstats2 # Think Stats 2 module containing Pmf and Cdf constructors
import thinkplot # Think Stats 2 module containing Pmf and Cdf plotters
import numpy as np
np.random.seed(1234)
sample = np.random.random(1000)
cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(sample)
pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(sample)

thinkplot.PrePlot(2, cols = 2) # side by side plots
thinkplot.Pmf(pmf, label = 'PMF(x)', linewidth = 0.1) # suppress this legend in .Config()
thinkplot.Config(title = 'PMF of Sample from Uniform Distribution', 
	xlabel = 'x', ylabel = 'PMF(x)', legend = False)
thinkplot.SubPlot(2) # switch to 2nd figure on right
thinkplot.Cdf(cdf, label = 'CDF(x)') # suppress this legend in .Show()
thinkplot.Show(title = 'CDF of Sample from Uniform Distribution', 
	xlabel = 'x', ylabel = 'CDF(x)', legend = False)
```

>> Looking at both the PMF and CDF, it appears that the sample's distribution
>> is essentially uniform, which validates the random.random() generated values.

>> Each line in the PMF has probability of 0.0010, which demonstrates that 
>> each value in the sample has equal probability.

>> The CDF plot shows a virtually straight 45-degree line, which indicates that
>> that for each value in the sample, the corresponding percentile rank is 
>> basically the same. That is, for x = 0.2, its percentile rank (CDF(x)) = 0.2.
